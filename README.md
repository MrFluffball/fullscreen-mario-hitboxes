i discovered [fullscreen mario](https://www.pramuwaskito.org/game/mario/) a couple days ago, and got the idea to mod it because i'm bored.
this was mostly just two days of reading code. I don't recommend it.

anyway, to run this mess, put the contents of min.js into a bookmark url. then run it at that link up there. enjoy!
